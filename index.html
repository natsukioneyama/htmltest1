  <div class="footer-text">
    <p>Natsuki Oneyama was born in Japan. Influenced by both fashion and art, he relocated to Paris, where he pursued a range of client-based projects before shifting his focus to studio makeup.
     
    <br><br>He was deeply inspired by the theatricality of 90s Martin Margiela and the experimental spirit of Japan’s 1960s–70s underground scene, which awakened in him a fascination with stage makeup and avant-garde art.
     After gaining experience as an assistant on major editorials and backstage at fashion shows, he eventually became independent.

     <br><br>Today, he continues to explore personal projects, seeking forms of expression beyond the conventional boundaries of editorial work.
     He has shaped a unique aesthetic language rooted in both Japanese and French sensibilities.
     His approach moves between restraint and emotion, structure and chance—where minimal gestures carry poetic weight.
     Rather than following trends, he draws inspiration from drawing, video, and digital media, using makeup to sketch moods and suggest alternate forms of identity.</p>
    
     <p>Natsuki’s work has been published in BEAUTY PAPERS, REPLICA MAN, VOGUE Ukraine, VOGUE Mexico, VOGUE China, Numéro Switzerland, Numéro Switzerland Homme, 10, 10 Men, Dapper Dan, The Greatest Magazine, Lampoon, NOWNESS ...
      
     <br><br> He has also collaborated with brands such as Givenchy Homme, Adidas, Delvaux, Clarins, CHANEL Beauty, GIVENCHY Beauty, YSL Beauty, SHISEIDO, Decléor, Swarovski, Arthus Bertrand, Piaget...</p>
